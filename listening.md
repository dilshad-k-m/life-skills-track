## <ins> 5. Passive Communication

I switch to passive style when the other person is a respectable person like my parents or teacher. Also in formal meeting i keep a passive style of communication

## <ins> 6. Active Communication

In most situations i behave in a passive way. If iam fed up with explaining or requesting something repeatedly then i directly switch to aggressive style since the listener is not paying any attention to me.

## <ins> 7. Passive aggressive 

Actually iam not a person who mocks others with or without their awareness. Moreover, iam not a person who treat others badly or the one who supports it.

## <ins> 8. Assertive communication

I can make my communication assertive by mentioning about my needs to others while respecting their wants at the same time. Assertive way of communication is the most freindly communication where the speaker is deplomatic. There are many steps that i can take for this. I have to learn to express my feelings before anybody. I have to learn to recognize what i need while considering others needs. Moreover, I want to express what iam saying with my body language. I want to respond in time without being quite for sometime.
