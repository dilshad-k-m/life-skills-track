## <ins> 1. Grit and growth

Angela, a maths teacher understands that IQ was not only the difference between best and worst students. After many years she learnt that one should treat the students in the form of a motivational perspective. So, she went to become a psychologist. She found that the quality of grit in students is the key factor that decides someones life. Grit is passion and perserverance for very long term goals. It is having stamina and sticking with future for a long period of time and work hard to make it reality. Grit is not related with talent or intelligence. The students with grit has more chance to get graduated than the others. Inorder to build grit in students, there should be growth mindset. We need to take over best ideas and to test them. We need to measure if we have been succesful. We should be willing to be wrong and start over again.

There are two types of mindsets. Fixed and growth mindset. People with fixed mindsets believes that skills and intelligence are set and they either have it or don't.But, the one with growth mindset believes that skills and intelligence are grown and developed. People who are good at something are good because they built that ability and people who aren't are not good because they haven't done. But, the People with fixed mindset believe that they are not in control of there abilities,skills are born and they can't learn and grow.

I wish to be like the people with growth mindset. Because, then only we can beleive in our abilities and move forward. The problem is being with a fixed mindset is that, we are afraid of challenges and loss hope to the way to success. The intend to do new things and experiment is the one that will take to success .

It is the realization that the results of our works are due to the actions that are alone from our side. Means that other than external factors, its our own attitude,behaviour and approach to certain situations is what makes the result. Its only the intend of a person that makes counts in the result.

The intention to do something is a great quality to have. Growth mindset allows one to do new tasks without the fear of failure. The people with growth mindset will always have the positive approach towards any situations. The one that lacks it will always find themseleves as useless and reluctant towards doing new things. The one with fixed mindset thinks that they cannot do new things as they believe skills are born and cannot be growned. All they have to do is to adapt and understand that anybody can do these things and its not limited to somebody who is more brilliant.
