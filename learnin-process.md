# <INS> HOW TO LEARN USING FEYNMAN TECHNIQUE

According to Feynman if someone has to understand a concept thoroughly then he should explain that to others. One of the effective way of learning is to teach others what we have learned. There are four steps for doing this technique.

1. Take a piece of paper and write the concept name at the top.
2. Explain the concepts using simple language.
3. Identify the problem areas and go back to the sources to review.
4. Mark any complex term and solve it by simplifying them and it should be in the form that anyone can easily understand it.

The way of explaining the concepts to someone who has not that much knowledge in the subject than us, should be in a simpler way. It also tests our ultimate knowledge in the subject as well. This technique helps to understand in which all areas of the subject does we have solid knowledge.

*In my learning ways i wish to include this technique because, it is an efficient way to improve learning process. As i work in a collaberative environment i wish to share my knowledge to the co-worker in need. It will help others and myself as well.

# <ins> LEARNING HOW TO LEARN

Barbara Oakley, a professor of engineering shares her experience about how she reached at the peak of her carrier from nowhere. Before she was in 10th grade, she had already lived in ten different places. Since she had no money to go to college she joined army right after her school studies. She learned Russian language and ended up working out on Soviet trawlers. The coworking engineers in the military had the powerful techniques for problem solving. She thought about learning those ideas. So she met top professors from around the world who had not only knows difficult concepts, but also knows how to teach them. She researched in neuro science and cognitive psychology. She found the ways to learn effectively. According to her, the brain's operation has two modes. **Focus** and **Diffuse** mode. Our brain toggles between these modes during learning period. If we are learning things we already know it enters in Focus mode. If we are learning new things it enters diffuse mode. The focus is very less in the diffuse mode. So if we get stuck during learning new stuffs just let the diffuse mode let the task in background. After sometimes we can use the ideas from diffuse mode in focus mode. She mentions about how great scientists has used the same techniques during inventions. Procrastination can often cause pain in the brain. **Pomodoro** technique is solution for this problem. In this technique we have to set a timer and make sure everything else is turned off during this period. Here we are focusing and relaxing at the same time. The one with less memory is the one who is more creative. Someone who is slow at studying things are the one who have solid mastery at it. Practicing within few days can increase our ability to both learn and remember. Always exercise and recall the stuffs that we already learned.

# <ins> LEARN ANYTHING IN 20 HOURS

According to Josh Kaufman if we invest ourselves in 20 hours for learning, then it is possible to have a deep knowledge in what we have learned. He read books and visited websites to know how long it will take to acquire new skills. Practicing multiple times is the only way to reach at the top of the field. In a test conducted by the researchers on participants it is concluded that only after practicing more times a task is the way in which the performing time on that task reduces. To achieve this there are four steps. First of all, we must deconstruct the skills. The more we break the skills, the more easier will be our learning process. Then we should learn enough to self correct. Also we have to avoid all the barriers that blocks our practices. The final step is to practice atleast 20 hours.

I would like to apply this method of learning in my learning process. I will try to practice and revise all the stuffs i learned and practice it atleast 20 hours. It seems like a very productive and effective way for learning.
