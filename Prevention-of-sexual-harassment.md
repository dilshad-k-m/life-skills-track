### <INS> QUID PRO QUO

It means "this for that". For example, let us consider a scenario in an office. When an employer gives punishment to the employee in  a sexual manner by threatening that he will be fired or demoted if he refuses to do so. Sometimes the co-workers do this to an employee but, they only have to prove that the behaviour was offensive to someone even it was not the intended person.

## <INS>HOW DO I REACT

When i face any situations like these or witness someone abusing another in public, i will move legally forward. There are laws and punishments for those who harass others sexually by any means. First of all i would try to calm down the situaton a little bit by consoling the victim and make the culprit understand the seriousness of the situation. I would explain him about the consequences he will face if i move legally forward. If he is ignoring everything then i will obviously go to the police station and register the case.
