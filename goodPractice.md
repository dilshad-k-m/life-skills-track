# <ins> 2. Area i need to improve
  
 It's very normal to get stuck during a new work. But, i always find it very difficult to move further after i got stuck somewhere. I think its very vital to change it since it can have a great impact on my career. So, i will try to find quick solutions to resolve the problem. Moreover i will find all possible ways to get the loophole like reaching out peoples, searching on the internet, contacting the mentor or manager with the issue explained. Also i will change my attitude  towards it and set it as a task or challenge that i must solve.
